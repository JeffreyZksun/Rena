-Kai to build the initial framework of how skView, skApp, skElement work together.
-Lori to build a protoype by using paper.js as our displaying engine.
  
 only support point/line.

next that:
-merge the code base to work together on more detailed features:
   * connectors
   * text
   * more geometry types
   * ...

===================
Now we have some basic functionalities ready like creating/moving/rotating/resizing lines and ovals. We have a MS powerpoint like bounding box.

we also have a javascript none-linear equations system solver in hand. the next step is building a constraint solver upon it.

We have also identified Google Closure as our UI library.

next:

-- Lori will be responsible for creating the tool bar using Google Closure library.

-- Kai will try to add the constraint solving functionality and the dimension edit UI.
